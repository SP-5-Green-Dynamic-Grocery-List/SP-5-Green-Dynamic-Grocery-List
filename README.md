A Grocery List Application using React Native, Expo Go, and Firebase.

This is a work-in-progress application that will allow users to create and edit grocery lists- as well as add other users such as their family or friends to collaborate on the list and make changes together.

The app features realtime synchronization through Firebase, where updates and changes made within the application are updated and displayed in realtime.

The app also utilizes Kroger Location and Product API, which will allow the application to retrieve product data about specific items, and display images, price, and location in-store to the user. This can help additionally with budgeting and planning out a shopping
route within the store.
